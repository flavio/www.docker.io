## Docker

Docker  is an open-source engine that automates the deployment of any application as a lightweight, portable,
    self-sufficient container that will run virtually anywhere.

Docker containers can encapsulate any payload, and will run consistently on and between virtually any server. The same
    container that a developer builds and tests on a laptop will run at scale, in production*, on VMs,
    bare-metal servers, OpenStack clusters, public instances, or combinations of the above.

Common use cases for Docker include:

*   Automating the packaging and deployment of applications
*   Creation of lightweight, private PAAS environments
*   Automated testing and continuous integration/deployment
*   Deploying and scaling web apps, databases and backend services

\* Please note Docker is currently under heavy developement. It should not be used in production (yet).

## Learn what Docker is all about

The following presentation explains what Docker is in laymen terms and then goes into more detail what makes Docker
    special and different from virtual machines.
